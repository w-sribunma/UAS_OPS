We have deviated from the previous year's PX4Vision drone due to the discontinuation of the development kit by Holybro. Holybro X500 Holybro's X500 quadrotor frame provides sufficient stability along with the capacity to carry neccessary onboard sensors. Vehicle Specification: Wheelbase: 500mm Motor mount pattern: 16x16mm Frame Body: 144x144mm, 2mm thick Landing gear height: 215 mm Space between top and bottom plates: 28mm Weight: 610g Note: Battery we plan to use is 4S 4000mAh 30C Lipo Battery Pixhawk RPi CM4 Baseboard and On-board Computer For the Flight Controller board, the Pixhawk RPi CM4 Baseboard with the Pixhawk 6X FC Module option will be used to allow an onboard flight computer with the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 . This UAS model will have the onboard computing capability from the Raspberry Pi along with the addition Google Cloral to aid the computational power for use in future computations of navigation, Computer Vision, and other computationally inefficient processes. 2D Lidar Sensor For distance and awareness data, a 2D 360 degrees Lidar will be equipped onboard the X500 frame.","title":"X500 Build Parts"},{"location":"X500-model/#holybro-x500-model-custom-build-with-raspberry-pi-onboard-computer","text":"For the IEEE Drone Maze 2024 competition to be proposed to host at ICRA 2024 in Yokohama, Japan, Purdue University team proposes a custom-improved model for the Holybro X500 model.

Flight Controller (FC) Flight controller (often called FC) is an essential component for any UAS aircraft, consisting of internal sensors required for UAS's detection of its orientation and movements in space. The FC is the center of all UAS computations and communications between its components and any ground control station connecting to the UAS, allowing processing of critical mission parameters and connected sensors. Some of the common sensors onboard the FC includes: Accelerometers Provide an instantaneous acceleration data for the drone's motion Gyroscopic sensor A gyro sensor works to provide rotational motion awareness for the UAS Barometer Utilizes atmospheric pressure to determine altitude Magnetometer Obtain magnetic heading and compass data Note that most FC may contain multiple of the same sensors for redundency. Power Module Power Modules are what connects a battery to the Flight Controllers, Motors, or some other components. It has an internal voltage regularator, ensuring that a constant 5V power can be used to power an applicable FC. Prior to selecting power module, we suggest checking the specification of your UAS components to ensure compatibility and sufficient power outputs. RC Receivers (RX) Receivers are crucial for any RC operations and safety measures. Receivers are what will communicate with an RC transmitter to allow manual command inputs from Pilot to the UAS. We recommend all UAS operations to have a manual RC overrides and kill switch set up for safety. The receivers are directly connected to the FC, communicating with the UAS through different transmission protocals Transmitter (TX) Transmitters are remote controllers that remotely communicate with the receivers to provide inputs for the UAS. Telemetry Radios Telemetry radios transmit messages among the UAS to its respective Ground Control Station (GCS) the GCS can receive messages such as attitude, altitude, GPS data, and speed. This is useful when performing outdoor UAS operations where flight data can be read by ground pilots.","title":"Hardware"},{"location":"hardware/#drone-hardwares","text":"This section will discuss some main hardware required for drone building and RC UAS operational components.","title":"Drone Hardwares"},{"location":"hardware/#flight-controller-fc","text":"Flight controller (often called FC) is an essential component for any UAS aircraft, consisting of internal sensors required for UAS's detection of its orientation and movements in space.
